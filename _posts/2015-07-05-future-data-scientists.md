The results of this <a href="http://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2015/06/test-fit-data-scientist/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+AnalyticsVidhya+%28Analytics+Vidhya%29">post</a> which claims to help you decide whether you are a good fit to become a data scientist or not.

There is no problem with the set of questions or the methodology But there has to be a word of caution to takers of this quiz….scoring highly on the quiz has little to do with predicting whether you will actually get a job as a data scientist. The simple reason being the prior probability of getting hired/shifting into a data scientist role is very very less.

According to my own research there are only 0.2% data science plus analytics jobs in the market. And if the readers are mislead into believing that they are the future data scientists, then its plain wrong on the part of the author.

Now this is where I am coming here. There is a well documented bias amongst researchers called representativeness bias, which states that if someone looks, behaves, acts like another person, human beings believe that there is a good chance that he will become/is the other person. The other person in this case is a data scientist. This high probabilty is attributed without taking into account the very low prior probability …. thus violating the bayes rule.

This said, Its good to motivate students to learn the necessary tricks of the trade, but making a tool which inadvertently leads people to think they are the upcoming data scientist is just misleading them.
